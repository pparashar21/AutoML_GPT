# AutoML_GPT

Description:
This project aims to simplify the process of machine learning model creation, training, and evaluation through an intuitive conversational interface. Leveraging the power of ChatGPT's language understanding capabilities and the QdrantClient for document storage, the AutoML Assistant allows users to interactively design, train, and evaluate machine learning models using custom documentation. The project provides a seamless experience for users to specify model configurations, perform hyperparameter tuning, and analyze model performance through natural language queries.

#### Below is the workflow of the project :
